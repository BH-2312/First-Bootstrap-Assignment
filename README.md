# First-Bootstrap-Assignment
Homework week 2 for BootCamp

The task was to develop 3 mobile-first html documents that were responsive and functioned well on a variety of screen sizes and devices.

It required a navbar, a responsive layout and responsive images with some template examples provided.

To complete the task I did the following:

I started by creating a basic html layout with a link to bootstrap , a style.css stylesheet and the appropriate viewport meta tag in 3 html files, index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html. I ensured I used semantic tags throughout the html.
I used bootstrap to create a navbar for each html document. I altered the navbar to reflect my personal style preference and to link to the correct pages.
I then worked further on the index.html document, using rows and columns and a card layout from bootstrap. I edited the card layout and added an image.
I worked on contact.html using a bootstrap form which I edited to reflect the correct types of inputs (text, email etc).
I used a different card layout for portfolio.html, which I again edited to reflect my preferred layout. I added images of classic video games.
I used the style.css stylesheet to further style the pages, to reflect the correct look of the web pages.
I added a media query to the bottom of the style sheet to ensure that the page looked good and functioned well on smaller screen sizes.
